# Pre-flight check for Artifact Registry push access.
#
# Verifies that the target AR repository exists and the active service
# account has permission to push images. Intended to run as an early
# Cloud Build step so IAM errors are caught in seconds instead of after
# a long multi-arch build.
#
# Usage:
#   verify-registry.sh <registry>
#
# Example:
#   verify-registry.sh us-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo
